Side Effects -     we will restrict ourselves to constructing programs  
  using only pure functions with **no side effects such as reading from files or mutating memory.**- Functional Programming in Scala-Manning Publications \(2014\)

**Functional Programming, Simplified\_ \(Scala edition\) \(2017\)**

in other words, functions that have no side effects.

What are side effects? A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a

result, for example:

Modifying a variable

Modifying a data structure in place

Setting a field on an object

Throwing an exception or halting with an error

Printing to the console or reading user input

Reading from or writing to a file

Drawing on the screen
