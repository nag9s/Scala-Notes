Tuples are ordered sets of values; you can think of tuples like records in a table in a relational database,

where each element or value can be referenced by position. The position of the value in the tuple has

some relevance, unlike the position of an element in a list. Tuples can contain objects with a mixture of

data types. Also like lists, tuples are immutable data structures.
